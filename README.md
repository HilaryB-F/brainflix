# BrainFlix

_Netflix and Youtube combined!_

This was a 3 week sprint during my software engineering bootcamp, my first time using react! I loved working on this project as it showed me just how much there is in the sofware engineering world. 

Although this is not a fully functional site, I learned so much. I fell in love with using React during this project. Everything fell into place while building this website, I learned about backend APIs, and about React Router. What I learned on this project will help me for the rest of my career. 

During the second week, my computer crashed and I lost several days of hard work. I was devastated, but what I had spent several days doing I was able to redo within a few hours. Like I said, I learned alot during this project and the most important of all was that I knew what I was doing! How exciting is that!

Have a look at my BrainFlix project, it was a wild ride.
